# Temperatures
## The process
**Problem** 
The program examines temperature records to determine which ones are the closest to zero.

**Rules** 
Write a program that prints the temperatures closest to 0 among the input data. 
If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integers have to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).

**Result** 
This program reads the data from the standard input and writes the result to the standard output. 
N: number of the temperatures to analyze 
t: temperature expressed as an integer ranging from-273 to 5526
and also displays 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0 degrees.
